        <p>“As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.” — Henry David Thoreau</p>
        <p>“Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.” ― Winston Churchill</p>
